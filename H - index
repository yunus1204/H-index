Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

Example 2:

Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1


// code

class Solution{
public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
    int n = citations.length;
    int maxHIndex = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int currentCitations = citations[i];
        int co = 0;

        // Count the number of papers with at least currentCitations citations
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (citations[j] >= currentCitations) {
                co++;
            }
        }

        // Check if the currentCitations value satisfies the H-index condition
        if (co >= currentCitations) {
            maxHIndex = Math.max(maxHIndex, currentCitations);
        }
    }

    return maxHIndex;
}

}
